                My first project was the "Portfolio 1" project. This project allowed
                us to create a sample website, using HTML and CSS, based on our liking.
                The meaning of this project was to test what we were capable of doing
                with limited resources, HTML and CSS alone, and hard work to produce a
                website.

                Our second project is this refined version of our "Portfolio 1"
                project. This time we are using HTML, CSS, and BootStrap to code and
                design our website.
